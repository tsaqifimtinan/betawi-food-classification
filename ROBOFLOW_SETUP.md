# Roboflow Food Classification Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Android camera app has been modified to integrate with Roboflow's food classification API. Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## Required Changes

### 1. Update Model Configuration
In `MainActivity.java`, update these constants with your actual Roboflow model details:

```java
private static final String ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = "dTilJcee6cDC3qrVQKFH";
// TODO: Replace with your actual model endpoint
private static final String MODEL_ENDPOINT = "/your-food-model/1";
```

To find your model endpoint:
1. Go to your Roboflow dashboard
2. Navigate to your food classification model
3. Go to the "Deploy" tab
4. Look for the "Hosted API" section
5. Your endpoint will look like: `/your-workspace/your-model/version`

### 2. Model Type Considerations
The app supports different Roboflow model types:
- **Object Detection**: Returns predictions with bounding boxes
- **Classification**: Returns top predicted class
- **Multi-label Classification**: Returns multiple predicted classes

The `displayClassificationResults()` method handles all these formats automatically.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Camera Integration
- Camera preview with TextureView
- Image capture functionality
- Image display in thumbnail view

### ✅ Roboflow API Integration
- Multipart form upload (primary method)
- Base64 upload (fallback method)
- Automatic retry with different formats
- Comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Response Processing
- JSON parsing of Roboflow responses
- Support for multiple response formats
- Confidence score display
- User-friendly result messages

### ✅ UI Updates
- Progress indicators during classification
- Button state management
- Toast notifications for results
- Renamed "Upload" to "Classify Food"

## Testing the Integration

1. **Build and Run**: Compile and install the app on your device/emulator
2. **Take Photo**: Use "Take Picture" button to capture food image
3. **Classify**: Press "Classify Food" button to send to Roboflow
4. **Review Results**: Classification results will appear in a toast message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Authentication Errors (401)
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check if your Roboflow account has sufficient credits

#### 2. Model Not Found (404)
- Verify the MODEL_ENDPOINT matches your actual model
- Ensure your model is deployed and public (or you have access)

#### 3. Invalid Image Format (400/415)
- The app automatically tries base64 encoding as fallback
- Check Roboflow logs for specific format requirements

#### 4. Network Errors
- Ensure device has internet connectivity
- Check if your network allows HTTPS requests to external APIs

### Debug Information
- All API responses are logged with tag "MainActivity"
- Use Android Studio's Logcat to view detailed error messages
- Enable verbose logging for network requests if needed

## API Response Examples

### Object Detection Response
```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "class": "pizza",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "x": 320,
      "y": 240,
      "width": 200,
      "height": 150
    }
  ]
}
```

### Classification Response
```json
{
  "top": "pizza",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Model Endpoint**: Replace the placeholder with your actual model endpoint
2. **Test with Real Food Images**: Try different food types to verify accuracy
3. **Customize UI**: Add more detailed result displays if needed
4. **Error Handling**: Implement more specific error messages based on your needs

## Security Notes

- API key is currently hardcoded - consider moving to BuildConfig for production
- Implement proper API key management for production apps
- Consider adding request timeout configurations

## Performance Considerations

- Images are compressed to 90% JPEG quality to reduce upload time
- Network requests are asynchronous to avoid blocking UI
- Progress indicators provide user feedback during classification

---

Your app is now ready to classify food images using Roboflow! Just update the model endpoint and test with your specific food classification model.
